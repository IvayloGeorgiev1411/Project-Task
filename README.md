# React TypeScript Project with JSONPlaceholder

This project is a React application built with TypeScript, which interacts with the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/). The app allows users to view, create, and explore detailed views of posts.

## Features

- **View Latest Posts**: Fetches and displays the latest 20 posts from the JSONPlaceholder API.
- **Post Details**: Click on any post to view a detailed version with full content.
- **Create New Post**: Users can create and submit new posts, which are sent to the API, but not visualized as the API only returns a "fake" response, which does not update the database.(Could be seen as a console log)
